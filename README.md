# The Mission

SneekSave is a high-performance web application built with the aim of demystifying media discovery and personal archiving. In an era where content is fragmented across thousands of platforms, SneekSave acts as a unified, stealthy portal. It allows users to search for their favorite content, preview it instantly, and save it for offline use—all without the clutter, tracking, or invasive ads typical of traditional downloaders.

2. Stealthy Speed: Powered by a Rust-optimized backend (uv) and a cutting-edge React 19 frontend for near-instant responses.
3. Quality & Control: Choose your resolution, trim clips to the exact second, or extract high-fidelity audio (MP3) with one click.
4. Privacy Centric: No trackers, no bloat. Just the media you want, delivered to your device.
